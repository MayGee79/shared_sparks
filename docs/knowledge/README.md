2. Make necessary changes to update information
3. Add new sections if needed
4. Update the "Last Updated" timestamp at the bottom

## Best Practices
- Include code snippets with language specifiers
- Use clear headings and subheadings (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
- Reference other knowledge documents when relevant
- Keep documentation concise but comprehensive
- Use bullet points for lists of related items
- Include diagrams or flowcharts when helpful (place in the same directory)
